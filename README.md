# ShortsWeatheR

ShortsWeatheR is an R package designed for training purposes. 

It includes two primary functions: 
- IsItShortsWeather
- ShouldIDryMyClothes

These are designed to retrieve weather data from weatherapi to gather current weather information and forecast data and provide answers to the questions. 

## Installation
To install the WeatherUtility package, you can use the devtools package. If you don't have devtools installed, you can install it using:

`install.packages("devtools")`

Then, you can install the ShortsWeatheR package from GitHub:

## Getting Started
First, you need to load the ShortsWeatheR package and set up your WeatherAPI key. You can get your API key by signing up at WeatherAPI.
